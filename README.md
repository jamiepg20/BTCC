What is BitsmileCoin?
----------------

BitsmileCoin is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a (Hybrid (PoW-Proof 0f Work/PoS) algorithm.
BitSmileCoin is a decentralized digital
currency like Bitcoin. It uses the same
encryption techniques of blockchain
technology to transfer and create
funds and to confirm transactions. The
SmileCoin Community aims to inspire,
be inspired, to educate and to
support its members.
BitSmileCoin (BTCC) is a peer-to-peer
Internet currency that enables instant,
near-zero cost payments to anyone in
the world. SmileCoin is an open
source, global payment network that
is fully decentralized without any
central authorities. Mathematics
secures the network and empowers
individuals to control their own
finances. SmileCoin features faster
transaction confirmation times and
improved storage efficiency than the
leading math-based currency. 
 - 40 Sec block targets
 - Block Reward: 40 
 - ~56 million total coins
 - ~POS Interest Rate: 5% 
 - ~Abbreviation: BTCC 

The rest is the same as Bitcoin.
 - 40 coins per block
 
 BITSMILECOIN SCRYPT ALGORITHM 
 ----------------
 originally named as s-crypt, but
pronounced as 'script'. This algorithm
incorporates the SHA-256 algorithm, but
its calculations are much more serialized
than those of SHA-256 in bitcoin. Scrypt
favor’s large amounts of high-speed RAM,
rather than raw processing power alone. 

ECO LIFE 
 ----------------
As the system continues to develop, we predict, based on the expected
number of application users, that there will be a balance between the supply
and demand for BitSmileCoin, which will ultimately lead to an increase in its
value. SmileCoin has all the prerequisites to be a viable replacement for FIAT
money, allowing millions of unbanked individuals to gain access to easier ways
of paying, while providing them the same opportunities as banked persons.
This is the key feature that will allow SmileCoin to be reused continuously, thus
forming a transactional eco-system. SmileCoin will offer access to both online
and offline transaction for services and goods to the wallet owners. We
foresee that this will solve challenges in many industries like: 

SCALABILITY
 ----------------
Being a cryptocurrency that uses a stable blockchain technology, BitSmileCoin’s
ecosystem is a scalable one. Its growth is only controlled by the amount of
SmileCoin in circulation at a certain point in time and the number of
transactions/reuses of the coin which are taking place. The total supply is
56,000,000 BTCC (56 million units)
